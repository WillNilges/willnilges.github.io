I"<p>So, if you’ve read my aboutme page recently, you’ll know that I’m currently working on putting together a cool custom controller for a GDD project for Imagine RIT 2020. Basically, the controller is going to be totally custom and will have many buttons, knobs, switches, dials, and displays so that people can walk by our booth and press fancy buttons to make random stuff happen in our game. (It’s more of a control panel, really). Basically, the panel will have the ability to impact the game world by activating abilities, changing stuff like gravity, screen orientation, etc. I want to make this happen by basically engineering a custom chassis, stuffing a bunch of really neat-o looking buttons inside, and having some kind of controller emulate keypresses</p>
