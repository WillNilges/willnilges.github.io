I"à<p>I recently gave a seminar on the basics of desktop environment (DE) customization at Computer Science House. I discussed how to customize your GNOME, KDE, and XFCE environments and where to get new themes, icons, and fonts.
    The talk started with
    <strong>What is a DE?</strong></p>

<p>Desktop Environments are graphical interfaces that make it easier for people to interface with computers. If you‚Äôve used a computer in the last 20 years, you‚Äôve used a DE.
      DEs usually come with a window manager, normally either floating (The windows can move around detached from everything and will float over each other and behind each other) or tiling (The windows take up the entire screen and typically can‚Äôt overlap except in tabbed mode). This allows you to multitask in an easy-to-understand way.
      A DE also usually has ‚Äúwidgets‚Äù that let you manage apps, power, wifi, sound, and desktop space more effectively. Typically, a DE will have a dock or a task bar that will display running processes as well as favorites, a system tray for getting info about your network status, battery status, audio status, time, CPU load, disk usage, RAM usage, and pretty much any other statistic you want about your computer.</p>

<p>Finally, a DE will sometimes (depending on your install) have apps like a graphical file manager, web browser, text editor, settings manager, photo viewer, archiving tool, etc etc etc. that let users do command line things on not the command line.
      <strong>Which DE should I use?</strong></p>

<p>The three most common DEs for newbies and experienced users alike are GNOME, KDE, and XFCE.</p>
