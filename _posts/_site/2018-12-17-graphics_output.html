<p>Did you know it’s possible to run Proprietary Nvidia drivers AND use Intel Integrated Graphics® to display the desktop?</p>

<p>Yeah. You just have to install the Nvidia drivers on a desktop and then go into the BIOS, enable the integrated graphics, and then set it as default video output. Then, just plug your video cable directly into the motherboard.</p>

<p>Do this, then you’ll have the whole GPU to throw at your OpenCL and Tensorflow stuff. Congrats.</p>

<p>I had to do this at work last week, so I’m just gonna toss this up on here.</p>
