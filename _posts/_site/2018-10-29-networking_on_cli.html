<p>So, if you have something like a ThinkPad X380 Yoga (or like, any of the newer, thiner ThinkPads) that has something like a proprietary Ethernet port <strong>or no network port at all</strong> then hereâ€™s how you set up networking and get your hardware pinging the internet on a bare Ubuntu (or not) install.</p>

<p>First, you need to add the device to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/etc/network</code>.</p>

<p>Add the device to your <code class="highlighter-rouge">interfaces</code> file which might look something like this:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  # This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
  # and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).
  
  source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*
  
  # The loopback network interface
  auto lo
  iface lo inet loopback
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>You will need to find the device name using
<code class="highlighter-rouge">ifconfig -a</code>
and then add the device to this file:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>iface *DEVICE NAME* inet dhcp
ifdown *DEVICE NAME*
ifup *DEVICE NAME*
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and then, assuming the divine forces will actually allow it, you should be able to network!</p>
